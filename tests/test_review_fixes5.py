"""Red-phase tests for _write_task_logs WARNING-level logging change.

Analysis
--------
Current implementation:
    except OSError as exc:
        logger.debug(
            "_write_task_logs: failed to write logs for task %r: %s",
            task_id,
            exc,
        )

Planned change:
    except OSError as exc:
        logger.warning(
            "_write_task_logs: failed to write logs for task %r: %s",
            task_id,
            exc,
        )

This test verifies that when ``Path.chmod`` raises ``OSError``, the exception
is logged at WARNING level (not DEBUG level).

Strategy
--------
* Use ``monkeypatch`` to replace ``pathlib.Path.chmod`` with a function that
  always raises ``OSError("chmod not supported")``.
* Call ``_write_task_logs`` directly (it is a module-level function).
* Assert that at least one log record at WARNING level from the
  ``parallel_orchestra.runner`` logger is present in ``caplog``.

This test FAILS against the current implementation (which uses
``logger.debug``) and PASSES once the fix changes it to ``logger.warning``.
